## Can I save my guest data?

**Yes!** When you decide to create an account, we can migrate your guest data:

- ✅ Your created tasks are saved to your new account
- ✅ Your journal entries are preserved
- ✅ Your progress and achievements carry over

**How it works:**
1. When you hit a limit or click "Sign Up" in the guest banner
2. Complete the sign-up process (Google or email)
3. You'll be asked: "Would you like to save your guest data?"
4. Click "Yes" and everything you created transfers to your account

**Note:** Demo data (pre-populated examples) won't transfer - only what you created yourself.

---

## How long does my guest session last?

**30 minutes** from when you first click "Try Demo."

**What happens when it expires?**
- You'll see a notification: "Your guest session has expired"
- Your created tasks and journals will be cleared
- You can start a new guest session or sign up to keep your data

**Pro tip:** If you're enjoying the app and want to keep your work, sign up before the 30 minutes are up!

---

## Is my data private in Guest Mode?

**Absolutely.** Privacy is a core value:

✅ **No account = no personal info**
- We don't ask for your name, email, or any personal details
- Your guest data is stored only on your device (not our servers)

✅ **Isolated sessions**
- Each guest session is completely separate
- You only see demo data and what you create
- No one else can see your guest activity

✅ **Auto-cleanup**
- Guest data is automatically deleted after 30 minutes
- Clearing your browser data also removes the session

✅ **No tracking**
- We don't track guest users across devices
- No cookies or persistent identifiers
- No third-party data sharing

**When you're a guest, your mental wellness journey is truly private.**

---

## What happens if I close my browser?

**Your guest session will be lost.**

Since guest data is stored only in your browser:
- Closing the browser clears the session
- Refreshing the page within 30 minutes keeps it alive
- Opening in a new tab/window maintains the session (same browser)

**If you want your data to persist**, create an account - then you can access it from any device, anytime.

---

## Can I use Guest Mode on multiple devices?

No, guest sessions are **device and browser-specific**.

If you start a guest session on your laptop, you won't see that data on your phone. Each device creates a separate guest session.

**Want to sync across devices?** Sign up for an account - your data will be available everywhere you log in.

---

## How do I upgrade from Guest Mode to a full account?

Easy! You have three ways:

**Option 1: When you hit a limit**
- Try to create your 6th task or 4th journal entry
- A modal will appear with "Sign Up" options
- Click "Sign Up with Google" or "Sign Up with Email"

**Option 2: Click the guest banner**
- At the top of your dashboard, you'll see: "You're in Guest Mode"
- Click the "Sign Up to Save Your Data" button
- Choose your sign-up method

**Option 3: When your session is expiring**
- Around 28-29 minutes, you'll get a notification
- Click "Sign Up Now" to save your progress before it's lost

**After signing up:**
- You'll be asked if you want to migrate your guest data
- Choose "Yes" and your tasks/journals will be saved
- Enjoy unlimited access to all features!

---

## Why do I see demo tasks and journals?

When you first enter Guest Mode, we **pre-populate demo data** so you can:

- See what the app looks like with real content
- Understand how tasks and journals work
- Get inspiration for your own entries
- Explore features without starting from scratch

**Demo data is clearly labeled** (e.g., "Try creating your first task" or "Example of a completed task").

You can:
- ✅ Edit or delete demo items
- ✅ Mark demo tasks as complete
- ✅ Create your own alongside the demos

**When you upgrade to a full account**, demo data stays behind - only your created content is migrated.

---

## Can I use AI features in Guest Mode?

**Not yet.** AI insights (powered by Google Gemini) require a full account.

This includes:
- ❌ AI-generated journal insights
- ❌ Mood pattern analysis
- ❌ Smart subtask suggestions

**Why?** AI features require server processing and personalized data storage, which isn't available for temporary guest sessions.

**Good news:** Sign up and you'll instantly unlock:
- 🤖 Personalized journaling insights
- 📊 Mood trend analysis
- ✨ AI-powered task suggestions
- 💡 Reflection prompts and coping strategies

---

## Will Guest Mode work offline?

**Yes!** After your first visit, the app works offline even in Guest Mode:

✅ **What works offline:**
- View your tasks and journals
- Navigate between pages
- See demo data
- Use affirmations
- View calendar

❌ **What requires internet:**
- Creating a guest session (first time)
- Syncing data (when you have an account)
- AI features (account-only anyway)

**Note:** Guest data created offline will still be cleared when the 30-minute session expires or you close your browser.

---

## Can I install the PWA as a guest?

**Yes!** You can install Serene Mind as a Progressive Web App even in Guest Mode.

**How to install:**

**On Mobile (iOS/Android):**
1. While in Guest Mode, look for "Install" or "Add to Home Screen"
2. Tap it and follow prompts
3. The app appears on your home screen like a native app

**On Desktop (Chrome/Edge):**
1. Look for the install icon in the address bar
2. Click "Install"
3. The app opens in its own window

**Important:** Even if you install the PWA as a guest:
- Your guest session still expires after 30 minutes
- Data is still cleared when you close the app
- You'll need to sign up for persistent data

**Pro tip:** Try the PWA in Guest Mode to see if you like the app experience, then sign up to keep your data!

---

## What happens after 30 minutes?

When your guest session expires:

1. **You'll see a notification:**
   - "Your guest session has expired"
   - Option to "Start New Guest Session"
   - Option to "Sign Up to Save Progress"

2. **Your created data is cleared:**
   - Tasks you created: deleted
   - Journal entries you wrote: deleted
   - Progress and achievements: reset

3. **Demo data remains:**
   - Pre-populated examples come back fresh
   - You can start a new guest session anytime

**To avoid losing your work:**

---

## Is Guest Mode always available?

**Yes!** Guest Mode is a permanent feature of Serene Mind App.

You can use it as many times as you want:
- ✅ Try it multiple times before signing up
- ✅ Use it for quick, temporary task lists
- ✅ Show friends how the app works
- ✅ Test new features we release

**No limit on how many guest sessions you can start.**

---

## Can I go back to Guest Mode after signing up?

**Not with the same account.** Once you create an account and sign in, you're using the full version with all your saved data.

However, you can:
- ✅ Sign out and start a new guest session (in a private/incognito window)
- ✅ Use Guest Mode on a different device
- ✅ Show Guest Mode to friends on your device (while logged out)

**Why would you want to?** Most users don't go back to Guest Mode because:
- Full accounts have unlimited tasks and journals
- Your data is always saved
- You get AI insights
- No 30-minute time limit

---

## How is Guest Mode different from a free account?

Great question! Here's the comparison:

| Feature | Guest Mode | Free Account |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Sign-up Required** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Google or Email) |
| **Task Limit** | 5 tasks | ✅ Unlimited |
| **Journal Limit** | 3 entries | ✅ Unlimited |
| **Session Duration** | 30 minutes | ✅ Unlimited |
| **Data Persistence** | ❌ Cleared on expiry | ✅ Saved forever |
| **AI Insights** | ❌ Not available | ✅ Full access |
| **Cross-Device Sync** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **PWA Install** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Offline Mode** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Privacy** | ✅ Maximum | ✅ High (encrypted) |
| **Cost** | ✅ Free | ✅ Free |

**Bottom line:** Both are free, but a full account gives you unlimited everything and saves your data permanently.

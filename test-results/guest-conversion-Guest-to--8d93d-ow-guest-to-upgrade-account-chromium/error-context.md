            - paragraph [ref=e29]: Are you tired of productivity apps that feel like another source of stress? Do rigid checklists lead to task paralysis, overwhelming you with guilt when you miss a streak?

It's hard to process feelings when you're constantly fighting against self-criticism and the pressure to 'do more, faster.'
